This documentation provides instructions for setting up and running a Streamlit app application locally, along with potential deployment steps. This application is designed to be run independently, but can also be integrated as part of a larger system.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Use pip or conda for managing Python packages. It’s recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Install Streamlit using pip or conda install other packages around Streamlit functionality at the virtual environment.
Clone the Repository.
Create virtual environment.
Activate the virtual environment.
Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages and install all dependencies.
Running the Applications Locally:

The Streamlit app provides an interactive web interface for users. It may involve data visualization, model predictions, or form inputs depending on your specific application.

Navigate to the Streamlit application directory (if in a subdirectory)
Run the Streamlit app by typing the following on the terminal or cmd line: streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the app.
Deployment:

Use Streamlit Sharing to deploy the app. Follow the instructions on the Streamlit Sharing website to deploy the app.

Push your code to a GitHub repository.
Go to Streamlit Cloud and sign in with your GitHub account.
Select your repository and the branch containing the Streamlit app.
Configure the app settings (e.g., the path to app.py), and click “Deploy.”
